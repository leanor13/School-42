# School 42

This is a set of projects I developed for School 42 curriculum. 

## About School 42

School 42 is a unique community that emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and real-world project experience. Established in France, it has grown into an international network of campuses, fostering a community of passionate developers. At School 42, there are no teachers; instead, students learn through collaborative projects and challenges, pushing each other to grow and innovate.

### Community and Collaboration

Being part of the School 42 community has been an incredible experience. The environment promotes creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving, allowing students to build not only technical skills but also lifelong connections with fellow coders from diverse backgrounds.

### Projects

Here are the projects I have worked on during my time at School 42.
Formatting and code styling are done according to Norminette rules - internal school formatter.

- **Exams**: A set of coding challenges that test various programming skills and knowledge acquired throughout the curriculum.

- **Philosophers**: A classic synchronization problem involving multiple philosophers who must alternate between eating and thinking, demonstrating understanding of concurrency and process management.

- **born2beroot**: A project focused on system administration and creating a Linux environment from scratch, showcasing skills in managing server configurations.

- **fract-ol**: A graphical project where students create fractals, emphasizing the understanding of graphical programming and mathematical concepts.

- **ft_printf**: A custom implementation of the standard printf function, allowing students to learn about variadic functions and formatting outputs.

- **get_next_line**: A project that involves creating a function to read a file line by line, enhancing skills in file handling and memory management.

- **libft**: A library of useful functions written in C, covering data structures and algorithms, aimed at reinforcing foundational programming concepts.

- **miniRT**: A simplified ray tracing project that introduces students to graphics programming, focusing on rendering 3D scenes and understanding light behavior.

- **misc**: Various smaller projects that explore different programming challenges and concepts.

- **pipex**: A project that implements a simplified version of the shell's pipe functionality, demonstrating skills in process management and inter-process communication.

- **pipex_minishell**: An extended version of pipex that includes additional features and functionalities, simulating a mini shell environment.

- **push_swap**: A sorting algorithm project that requires students to sort numbers in a stack efficiently, emphasizing algorithm design and optimization.
